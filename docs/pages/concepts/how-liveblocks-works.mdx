Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. The foundations of Liveblocks are built upon four
core concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each
enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences:
[Presence](/docs/products/presence), [Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast),
[Storage](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/storage), and
[Comments (private beta)](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/comments). You can
decide which products you’d like to use based on the requirements of the
collaborative experiences you’re building.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your
users to be [authenticated](/docs/rooms/authentication) to interact with rooms,
and each room can have specific [permissions](/docs/rooms/permissions) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

## Integrations

Liveblocks and its community provide integrations that developers can use to
integrate with the Liveblocks products within the rooms. You can use existing
integrations for specific libraries and frameworks, or create a custom one for
your needs.

## Platform

Liveblocks provides a fully-hosted platform built around a
[WebSocket infrastructure](/docs/platform/websocket-infrastructure) that scales
effortlessly to millions of users. The platform equips you with a set of
powerful tools such as our [REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints),
[webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks),
[schema validation](/docs/platform/schema-validation),
[analytics](/docs/platform/analytics), and more.
